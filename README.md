# Restaurant4u Data Science Project

Welcome to the Restaurant4u Data Science project, a comprehensive machine learning and analysis project focused on investigating how a restaurant's characteristics affect its rating. This project encompasses various stages, from data scanning and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and implementation of machine learning models.

## Project Presentation

### Part 1 - Data Crawling
**Main tools used:** Selenium

In the initial phase of the project, we employed Selenium as the primary tool for data crawling. This step involved extracting relevant data from various sources to create a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.

### Part 2 - Cleaning and Formatting the Data

Following the data collection phase, we dedicated efforts to cleaning and formatting the acquired data. This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information used in subsequent analyses.

### Part 3 - EDA Visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a vital aspect of this project. Through visualization techniques, we aim to gain insights into the patterns and trends within the data. This phase helps us better understand the characteristics of the restaurant-related data.

### Part 4 - Machine Learning Models

The project implements several machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost (XGB)
- Random Forest Regressor
- Linear Regression

These models are utilized to make predictions and draw meaningful conclusions based on the analyzed data. The application of machine learning enhances our understanding of various factors affecting the restaurant industry.

## Results

In conclusion, our project involved the activation of six different attempts on various machine learning models. After thorough evaluation, we identified that the most effective model is the Logistic Regression with a punishment penalty. This model provided the best performance, yielding a Mean Squared Error (MSE) result of 0.370. This outcome signifies the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting and understanding the factors influencing restaurant ratings.
